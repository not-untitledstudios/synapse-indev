# Synapse's Client (in-development)

*Ignore the license, it comes by default with Electron. Synapse will not be open-source upon release. Current contributors can continue to make changes after that, but newer ones may not be accepted.*

**Build Synapse with us!** Fork the repository and make your changes, once done, put them into the `suggestions` branch, where we'll decide to pull it into `main`.

# What is Synapse?

Synapse is a platform for gamers to share pictures and videos and to chat and for modders to distribute their mods on a store. For games, it uses 'Communities', a place to publish mods and posts. It includes an overlay for video games and has achivements for games that don't (and for those that do!)

We want Synapse to be the best it can be. So that's why we're making it open-source, avaliable for any contributions all of you may have.

Don't be shy, fork the repo and make your changes! We won't judge. :blush:
